# Java employee Creation
It is a program to create an details of an employee with business logic.
First i have created two different class Employee and Main class
In the Employee class,The main attributes of the employee is Name,Age,Salary,Designation.Their are three methods in the Employee class which are create,display and raiseSalary.
 To enter the details of the employee  I use "Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in)" to enter input manually.Create method will create the details of the employee,Display method will display the details we have created and raiseSalary method will increment the current salary to raised salary and salary will be raised by 1000.
 In Main method i have created the object of the employee by using reference variable as emp "Employee emp =new Employee();" where new jeyword creates the object of the Employee class.
 After that I have used switch condition to choose the different cases to perform, and i want this to perfrom repitatively so i used while loop which will perform repitatively until the condition fails.
